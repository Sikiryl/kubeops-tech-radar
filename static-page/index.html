                Dekorate is a collection of Java compile-time generators and
                decorators for Kubernetes/OpenShift manifests. It makes
                generating Kubernetes manifests as easy as adding a dependency
                to the classpath and customizing as simple as setting an
                annotation or application property

                <br /><br />
              <h4>Opinion</h4>

              Dekorate has some limitations about container resources and
              deployment strategies definition. We recommeded to use this with
              concern.

              <h4>Opinion</h4>

              We love this tool as we can use our favourite languages such as
              Typescript to define infrastructure components. However, we
              didn't evaluate enough if it would work smoothly on production,
              or multiple environments.

                Cloud platforms provide a wealth of benefits for the
                organizations that use them. However, there’s no denying that
                adopting the cloud can put strains on DevOps teams. Developers
                must use microservices to architect for portability, meanwhile
                operators are managing extremely large hybrid and multi-cloud
                deployments. Istio lets you connect, secure, control, and
                observe services.

              what's happening with automatic tracing, monitoring, and logging
              of all your services and control the flow of traffic and API

                Rio is an Application Deployment Engine for Kubernetes that can
                be layered on top of any standard Kubernetes cluster. Consisting
                of a few Kubernetes custom resources and a CLI to enhance the
                user experience, users can easily deploy services to Kubernetes
                and automatically get continuous delivery, DNS, HTTPS, routing,
                monitoring, autoscaling, canary deployments, git-triggered
                builds, and much more. All it takes to get going is an existing
                Kubernetes cluster and the rio CLI.

                <br /><br />
              <h4>Opinion</h4>
              It's an application deployment engine on top of Kubernetes just
              like OKD. However, it's still currently in Beta version. It can
              manage pipelines by few CLI commands.

              <h4>Opinion</h4>

              cdk8s makes our developers easier to work with Kubernetes
              deployment templates with their favourite languages such as
              Typescript and faster our delivery processes.

              We're using this on production and it helps us easier to manage
              Kubernetes YAML files for microservices in multiple environments
              with less logic and good maintainbility.

                Helm is an open source package manager for Kubernetes. It
                provides the ability to provide, share, and use software built
                for Kubernetes. Helm was created in 2015 at Deis, which was
                later acquired by Microsoft. What is now known as Helm Classic
                was introduced at the inaugural KubeCon that November. In
                January 2016, Helm Classic was merged with Google’s Deployment
                Manager for Kubernetes into the repository that is now the main
                Helm project. The project currently has more than 30,000 GitHub
                stars and receives more than 2 million downloads a month from
                across the globe. In April 2020, Helm hit graduated status
                within CNCF, joining the ranks of Fluentd, containerd, and
                others.

              <h4>Opinion</h4>

              Heim is a good tool to manage / install Kubernetes
              infrastructure tool as a package on Kubernetes cluster with yaml
              and go templating. However, our pain point is that if we use it
              for microservice deployments (not infrastructure tools), it
              could be adding addditional complex layers such as fragile yaml
              syntax, non-readable templates, difficult to exend it to many
              microservices. Our recommendation is we should use Helm for
              complex infrastructure components only.

                knowing, as they’re currently being used in many cloud
                platforms. A buildpack’s job is to gather everything your app
                needs to build and run, and it often does this job quickly and
                quietly. That said, while buildpacks are often a
                behind-the-scenes detail, they are at the heart of transforming
                your source code into a runnable app image.
